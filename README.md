# Maya Dickson's Portfolio

## About me
Hello, my name is Maya. I am a 3rd year Nueroscience student at Dalhousie University. Through a Neural Data Science course I was introduced to the world of Data Science and computer programming. I have begun my journey into learning Python code and below are a few examples of my work, welcome to my coding portfolio.

## Projects
### *Disney code*

Here is a [sample code](DisneyC.md) on sorting through movies based on their box office sales.

### *Super Bowl code*

#### Sample 1

Here is a [sample code](SuB.md) that uses a comparison operator to select and display certain Super Bowl games.
