## About me
Hello, my name is Maya. I am a 3rd year Nueroscience student at Dalhousie University. Through a Neural Data Science course I was introduced to the world of Data Science and computer programming. I have begun my journey into learning Python code and below are a few examples of my work, welcome to my coding portfolio.
