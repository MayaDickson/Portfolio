# Maya Dickson's Portfolio

## About me
Hello, my name is Maya. I am a 3rd year Nueroscience student at Dalhousie University. Through a Neural Data Science course I was introduced to the world of Data Science and computer programming. I have begun my journey into learning Python code and below are a few examples of my work, welcome to my coding portfolio.

## Projects
### *Disney code*

Here is a [sample code](DisneyC.md) on sorting through movies based on their box office sales.

### *Flanker-Simon code*

#### Assignment 2

*Sample 1*

Here are [3 different ways](A2_stat1.md) to perform descriptive statistics.

*Sample 2*



#### Assignment 3

*Sample 1*

Here is a [sample code](A3_H.md) on creating a histogram.

*Sample 2*

Here is a [sample code](A3_H2.md) on transforming a histogram.

### *Super Bowl code*

#### Sample 1

Here is a [sample code](SuB.md) that uses a comparison operator to select and display certain Super Bowl games.

Here is an [image](42B11AD1-4A12-43D4-B500-C2206E5431CC.jpeg) of this figure.

### *Google Ad code*

Here is a [sample code](Code3.md) on creating keyword combinations between two lists.

## Demos

### *DataCamp/Github demo*

This demo was created to show how you can take a DataCamp project notebook and download it onto CoCalc. This video also shows how you can download a Jupyter notebook, from Cocalc, onto a Github repository.
